With Clay, you can:

- **Enrich agent outputs**: Automatically feed your Sim agent data into Clay tables for structured tracking and analysis
- **Trigger workflows via webhooks**: Use Clay’s webhook support to initiate Sim agent tasks from within Clay
- **Leverage data loops**: Seamlessly iterate over enriched data rows with agents that operate across dynamic datasets

In Sim, the Clay integration allows your agents to push structured data into Clay tables via webhooks. This makes it easy to collect, enrich, and manage dynamic outputs such as leads, research summaries, or action items—all in a collaborative, spreadsheet-like interface. Your agents can populate rows in real time, enabling asynchronous workflows where AI-generated insights are captured, reviewed, and used by your team. Whether you're automating research, enriching CRM data, or tracking operational outcomes, Clay becomes a living data layer that interacts intelligently with your agents. By connecting Sim with Clay, you gain a powerful way to operationalize agent results, loop over datasets with precision, and maintain a clean, auditable record of AI-driven work.
