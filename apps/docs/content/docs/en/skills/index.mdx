Agent Skills are reusable packages of instructions that give your AI agents specialized capabilities. Based on the open [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) format, skills let you capture domain expertise, workflows, and best practices that agents can load on demand.

## How Skills Work

Skills use **progressive disclosure** to keep agent context lean:

1. **Discovery** — Only skill names and descriptions are included in the agent's system prompt (~50-100 tokens each)
2. **Activation** — When the agent decides a skill is relevant, it calls the `load_skill` tool to load the full instructions into context
3. **Execution** — The agent follows the loaded instructions to complete the task

This means you can attach many skills to an agent without bloating its context window. The agent only loads what it needs.

## Creating Skills

Go to **Settings** (gear icon) and select **Skills** under the Tools section.

Click **Add** to create a new skill with three fields:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Name** | A kebab-case identifier (e.g. `sql-expert`, `code-reviewer`). Max 64 characters. |
| **Description** | A short explanation of what the skill does and when to use it. This is what the agent reads to decide whether to activate the skill. Max 1024 characters. |
| **Content** | The full skill instructions in markdown. This is loaded when the agent activates the skill. |

<Callout type="info">
  The description is critical — it's the only thing the agent sees before deciding to load a skill. Be specific about when and why the skill should be used.
</Callout>

### Writing Good Skill Content

Skill content follows the same conventions as [SKILL.md files](https://agentskills.io/specification):

```markdown
# SQL Expert

## When to use this skill
Use when the user asks you to write, optimize, or debug SQL queries.

## Instructions
1. Always ask which database engine (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite)
2. Use CTEs over subqueries for readability
3. Add index recommendations when relevant
4. Explain query plans for optimization requests

## Common Patterns
...
```

## Adding Skills to an Agent

Open any **Agent** block and find the **Skills** dropdown below the tools section. Select the skills you want the agent to have access to.

Selected skills appear as chips that you can click to edit or remove.

### What Happens at Runtime

When the workflow runs:

1. The agent's system prompt includes an `<available_skills>` section listing each skill's name and description
2. A `load_skill` tool is automatically added to the agent's available tools
3. When the agent determines a skill is relevant to the current task, it calls `load_skill` with the skill name
4. The full skill content is returned as a tool response, giving the agent detailed instructions

This works across all supported LLM providers — the `load_skill` tool uses standard tool-calling, so no provider-specific configuration is needed.

## Tips

- **Keep descriptions actionable** — Instead of "Helps with SQL", write "Write optimized SQL queries for PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQLite, including index recommendations and query plan analysis"
- **One skill per domain** — A focused `sql-expert` skill works better than a broad `database-everything` skill
- **Use markdown structure** — Headers, lists, and code blocks help the agent parse and follow instructions
- **Test iteratively** — Run your workflow and check if the agent activates the skill when expected
