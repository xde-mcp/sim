title: Deploy Workflows as MCP
description: Expose your workflows as MCP tools for external AI assistants and applications
---

import { Video } from '@/components/ui/video'
import { Callout } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/callout'

Deploy your workflows as MCP tools to make them accessible to external AI assistants like Claude Desktop, Cursor, and other MCP-compatible clients. This turns your workflows into callable tools that can be invoked from anywhere.

## Creating and Managing MCP Servers

MCP servers group your workflow tools together. Create and manage them in workspace settings:

<div className="mx-auto w-full overflow-hidden rounded-lg">
  <Video src="mcp/mcp-server.mp4" width={700} height={450} />
</div>

1. Navigate to **Settings → MCP Servers**
2. Click **Create Server**
3. Enter a name and optional description
4. Copy the server URL for use in your MCP clients
5. View and manage all tools added to the server

## Adding a Workflow as a Tool

Once your workflow is deployed, you can expose it as an MCP tool:

<div className="mx-auto w-full overflow-hidden rounded-lg">
  <Video src="mcp/mcp-deploy-tool.mp4" width={700} height={450} />
</div>

1. Open your deployed workflow
2. Click **Deploy** and go to the **MCP** tab
3. Configure the tool name and description
4. Add descriptions for each parameter (helps AI understand inputs)
5. Select which MCP servers to add it to

<Callout type="info">
The workflow must be deployed before it can be added as an MCP tool.
</Callout>

## Tool Configuration

### Tool Name
Use lowercase letters, numbers, and underscores. The name should be descriptive and follow MCP naming conventions (e.g., `search_documents`, `send_email`).

### Description
Write a clear description of what the tool does. This helps AI assistants understand when to use the tool.

### Parameters
Your workflow's input format fields become tool parameters. Add descriptions to each parameter to help AI assistants provide correct values.

## Connecting MCP Clients

Use the server URL from settings to connect external applications:

### Claude Desktop
Add to your Claude Desktop config (`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "my-sim-workflows": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "mcp-remote", "YOUR_SERVER_URL"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Cursor
Add the server URL in Cursor's MCP settings using the same mcp-remote pattern.

<Callout type="warn">
Include your API key header (`X-API-Key`) for authenticated access when using mcp-remote or other HTTP-based MCP transports.
</Callout>

## Server Management

From the server detail view in **Settings → MCP Servers**, you can:

- **View tools**: See all workflows added to a server
- **Copy URL**: Get the server URL for MCP clients
- **Add workflows**: Add more deployed workflows as tools
- **Remove tools**: Remove workflows from the server
- **Delete server**: Remove the entire server and all its tools

## How It Works

When an MCP client calls your tool:

1. The request is received at your MCP server URL
2. Sim validates the request and maps parameters to workflow inputs
3. The deployed workflow executes with the provided inputs
4. Results are returned to the MCP client

Workflows execute using the same deployment version as API calls, ensuring consistent behavior.
