## Bring Your Own Key (BYOK)

Use your own API keys for AI model providers instead of Sim Studio's hosted keys.

### Supported Providers

| Provider | Usage |
|----------|-------|
| OpenAI | Knowledge Base embeddings, Agent block |
| Anthropic | Agent block |
| Google | Agent block |
| Mistral | Knowledge Base OCR |

### Setup

1. Navigate to **Settings** → **BYOK** in your workspace
2. Click **Add Key** for your provider
3. Enter your API key and save

<Callout type="warn">
  BYOK keys are encrypted at rest. Only organization admins and owners can manage keys.
</Callout>

When configured, workflows use your key instead of Sim Studio's hosted keys. If removed, workflows automatically fall back to hosted keys.

## Single Sign-On (SSO)

Enterprise authentication with SAML 2.0 and OIDC support for centralized identity management.

### Supported Providers

- Okta
- Azure AD / Entra ID
- Google Workspace
- OneLogin
- Any SAML 2.0 or OIDC provider

### Setup

1. Navigate to **Settings** → **SSO** in your workspace
2. Choose your identity provider
3. Configure the connection using your IdP's metadata
4. Enable SSO for your organization

<Callout type="info">
  Once SSO is enabled, team members authenticate through your identity provider instead of email/password.
</Callout>

## Self-Hosted

For self-hosted deployments, enterprise features can be enabled via environment variables:

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `SSO_ENABLED`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SSO_ENABLED` | Single Sign-On with SAML/OIDC |
| `CREDENTIAL_SETS_ENABLED`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_CREDENTIAL_SETS_ENABLED` | Polling Groups for email triggers |

<Callout type="warn">
  BYOK is only available on hosted Sim Studio. Self-hosted deployments configure AI provider keys directly via environment variables.
</Callout>
