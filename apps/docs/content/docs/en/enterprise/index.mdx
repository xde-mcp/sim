Sim Studio Enterprise provides advanced features for organizations with enhanced security, compliance, and management requirements.

---

## Access Control

Define permission groups to control what features and integrations team members can use.

### Features

- **Allowed Model Providers** - Restrict which AI providers users can access (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc.)
- **Allowed Blocks** - Control which workflow blocks are available
- **Platform Settings** - Hide Knowledge Base, disable MCP tools, or disable custom tools

### Setup

1. Navigate to **Settings** → **Access Control** in your workspace
2. Create a permission group with your desired restrictions
3. Add team members to the permission group

<Callout type="info">
  Users not assigned to any permission group have full access. Permission restrictions are enforced at both UI and execution time.
</Callout>

---

## Bring Your Own Key (BYOK)

Use your own API keys for AI model providers instead of Sim Studio's hosted keys.

### Supported Providers

| Provider | Usage |
|----------|-------|
| OpenAI | Knowledge Base embeddings, Agent block |
| Anthropic | Agent block |
| Google | Agent block |
| Mistral | Knowledge Base OCR |

### Setup

1. Navigate to **Settings** → **BYOK** in your workspace
2. Click **Add Key** for your provider
3. Enter your API key and save

<Callout type="warn">
  BYOK keys are encrypted at rest. Only organization admins and owners can manage keys.
</Callout>

When configured, workflows use your key instead of Sim Studio's hosted keys. If removed, workflows automatically fall back to hosted keys.

---

## Single Sign-On (SSO)

Enterprise authentication with SAML 2.0 and OIDC support for centralized identity management.

### Supported Providers

- Okta
- Azure AD / Entra ID
- Google Workspace
- OneLogin
- Any SAML 2.0 or OIDC provider

### Setup

1. Navigate to **Settings** → **SSO** in your workspace
2. Choose your identity provider
3. Configure the connection using your IdP's metadata
4. Enable SSO for your organization

<Callout type="info">
  Once SSO is enabled, team members authenticate through your identity provider instead of email/password.
</Callout>

## Self-Hosted Configuration

For self-hosted deployments, enterprise features can be enabled via environment variables without requiring billing.

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `ORGANIZATIONS_ENABLED`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_ORGANIZATIONS_ENABLED` | Enable team/organization management |
| `ACCESS_CONTROL_ENABLED`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_ACCESS_CONTROL_ENABLED` | Permission groups for access restrictions |
| `SSO_ENABLED`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SSO_ENABLED` | Single Sign-On with SAML/OIDC |
| `CREDENTIAL_SETS_ENABLED`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_CREDENTIAL_SETS_ENABLED` | Polling Groups for email triggers |

### Organization Management

When billing is disabled, use the Admin API to manage organizations:

```bash
# Create an organization
curl -X POST https://your-instance/api/v1/admin/organizations \
  -H "x-admin-key: YOUR_ADMIN_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "My Organization", "ownerId": "user-id-here"}'

# Add a member
curl -X POST https://your-instance/api/v1/admin/organizations/{orgId}/members \
  -H "x-admin-key: YOUR_ADMIN_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"userId": "user-id-here", "role": "admin"}'
```

### Notes

- Enabling `ACCESS_CONTROL_ENABLED` automatically enables organizations, as access control requires organization membership.
- BYOK is only available on hosted Sim Studio. Self-hosted deployments configure AI provider keys directly via environment variables.
