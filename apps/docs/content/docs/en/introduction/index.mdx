Sim is an open-source visual workflow builder for building and deploying AI agent workflows. Design intelligent automation systems using a no-code interface—connect AI models, databases, APIs, and business tools through an intuitive drag-and-drop canvas. Whether you're building chatbots, automating business processes, or orchestrating complex data pipelines, Sim provides the tools to bring your AI workflows to life.

## What You Can Build

**AI Assistants & Chatbots**  
Build intelligent conversational agents that integrate with your tools and data. Enable capabilities like web search, calendar management, email automation, and seamless interaction with business systems.

**Business Process Automation**  
Eliminate manual tasks across your organization. Automate data entry, generate reports, respond to customer inquiries, and streamline content creation workflows.

**Data Processing & Analysis**  
Transform raw data into actionable insights. Extract information from documents, perform dataset analysis, generate automated reports, and synchronize data across platforms.

**API Integration Workflows**  
Orchestrate complex multi-service interactions. Create unified API endpoints, implement sophisticated business logic, and build event-driven automation systems.

## How It Works

**Visual Workflow Editor**  
Design workflows using an intuitive drag-and-drop canvas. Connect AI models, databases, APIs, and third-party services through a visual, no-code interface that makes complex automation logic easy to understand and maintain.

**Modular Block System**  
Build with specialized components: processing blocks (AI agents, API calls, custom functions), logic blocks (conditional branching, loops, routers), and output blocks (responses, evaluators). Each block handles a specific task in your workflow.

**Flexible Execution Triggers**  
Launch workflows through multiple channels including chat interfaces, REST APIs, webhooks, scheduled cron jobs, or external events from platforms like Slack and GitHub.

**Real-time Collaboration**  
Enable your team to build together. Multiple users can edit workflows simultaneously with live updates and granular permission controls.

## Integrations

Sim provides native integrations with 80+ services across multiple categories:

- **AI Models**: OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini, Groq, Cerebras, local models via Ollama
- **Communication**: Gmail, Slack, Microsoft Teams, Telegram, WhatsApp  
- **Productivity**: Notion, Google Workspace, Airtable, Monday.com
- **Development**: GitHub, Jira, Linear, automated browser testing
- **Search & Data**: Google Search, Perplexity, Firecrawl, Exa AI
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL, MySQL, Supabase, Pinecone, Qdrant

For custom integrations, leverage our [MCP (Model Context Protocol) support](/mcp) to connect any external service or tool.

## AI-Powered Copilot

**Ask Questions & Get Guidance**  
Copilot answers questions about Sim, explains your workflows, and provides suggestions for improvements. Use the `@` symbol to reference workflows, blocks, documentation, knowledge, and logs for contextual assistance.

**Build & Edit Workflows**  
Switch to Agent mode to let Copilot propose and apply changes directly to your canvas. Add blocks, configure settings, wire variables, and restructure workflows with natural language commands.

**Adaptive Reasoning Levels**  
Choose from Fast, Auto, Advanced, or Behemoth modes depending on task complexity. Start with Fast for simple questions, scale up to Behemoth for complex architectural changes and deep debugging.

## Deployment Options

**Cloud-Hosted**  
Launch immediately at [sim.ai](https://sim.ai) with fully managed infrastructure, automatic scaling, and built-in observability. Focus on building workflows while we handle the operations.

**Self-Hosted**  
Deploy on your own infrastructure using Docker Compose or Kubernetes. Maintain complete control over your data with support for local AI models through Ollama integration.
