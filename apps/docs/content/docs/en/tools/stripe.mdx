{/* MANUAL-CONTENT-START:intro */}
[Stripe](https://stripe.com/) is a powerful payments platform that enables you to easily manage payments, customers, subscriptions, invoices, products, and more.

With Stripe integrated into Sim, your agents can:

- **Create and manage payment intents**: Process payments with flexible configuration options.
- **Work with customers**: Create, retrieve, and update customer records for your business.
- **Handle subscriptions**: Manage recurring billing and subscription lifecycles.
- **Create and send invoices**: Generate invoices for one-time or recurring payments.
- **Track and manage charges**: Retrieve and update charge objects for monitoring payments.
- **Configure products and prices**: Set up your catalog of products, pricing models, and offers.
- **Listen and react to Stripe events**: Trigger workflows in response to payment updates, successful charges, and other Stripe events.

By connecting Sim with Stripe, you enable seamless automation and financial operations within your agent workflows. Automate customer onboarding, subscription management, payment collection, invoice generation, and even custom actions when payment events occur—all handled directly by your agents, securely via Stripe.

Whether you’re building e-commerce automation, subscription services, or running reporting and reconciliation, the Stripe tool makes it easy to coordinate payments and financial data within your intelligent Sim workflows.
