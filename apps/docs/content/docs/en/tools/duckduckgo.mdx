[DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) is a privacy-focused web search engine that delivers instant answers, abstracts, related topics, and more — without tracking you or your searches. DuckDuckGo makes it easy to find information without any user profiling or targeted ads.

With DuckDuckGo in Sim, you can:

- **Search the web**: Instantly find answers, facts, and overviews for a given search query
- **Get direct answers**: Retrieve specific responses for calculations, conversions, or factual queries
- **Access abstracts**: Receive short summaries or descriptions for your search topics
- **Fetch related topics**: Discover links and references relevant to your search
- **Filter output**: Optionally remove HTML or skip disambiguation for cleaner results

These features enable your Sim agents to automate access to fresh web knowledge — from surfacing facts in a workflow, to enriching documents and analysis with up-to-date information. Because DuckDuckGo’s Instant Answers API is open and does not require an API key, it’s simple and privacy-safe to integrate into your automated business processes.
