{/* MANUAL-CONTENT-START:intro */}
[Clay](https://www.clay.com/) is a data enrichment and workflow automation platform designed to help teams streamline lead generation, research, and other data operations using powerful integrations and flexible input options.

In Sim, the Clay integration lets your agents seamlessly insert structured data into Clay workbooks via webhook triggers. This makes it easy to collect, enrich, and manage dynamic outputs—such as leads, research summaries, or action items—directly within a collaborative, spreadsheet-like interface.

With Clay, you can:

- **Enrich agent outputs**: Automatically feed your Sim agent data into Clay tables for structured tracking and analysis.
- **Trigger workflows via webhooks**: Use Clay’s webhook support to initiate Sim agent tasks directly from Clay or have agents send data to Clay as part of your workflow.
- **Leverage data loops**: Seamlessly iterate over enriched data rows with agents that operate across dynamic datasets.

The integration supports workflows where your agents populate rows in real time, enabling asynchronous, collaborative work. Whether you're automating research, enriching CRM data, or tracking operational outcomes, Clay becomes a living data layer that interacts intelligently with your agents. By connecting Sim with Clay, you can operationalize agent-generated results, automate dataset processing, and maintain an auditable, up-to-date record of AI-driven work.
