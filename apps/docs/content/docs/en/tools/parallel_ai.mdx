{/* MANUAL-CONTENT-START:intro */}
[Parallel AI](https://parallel.ai/) is an advanced web search and content extraction platform designed to deliver comprehensive, high-quality results for any query. By leveraging intelligent processing and large-scale data extraction, Parallel AI enables users and agents to access, analyze, and synthesize information from across the web with speed and accuracy.

With Parallel AI, you can:

- **Search the web intelligently**: Retrieve relevant, up-to-date information from a wide range of sources  
- **Extract and summarize content**: Get concise, meaningful excerpts from web pages and documents  
- **Customize search objectives**: Tailor queries to specific needs or questions for targeted results  
- **Process results at scale**: Handle large volumes of search results with advanced processing options  
- **Integrate with workflows**: Use Parallel AI within Sim to automate research, content gathering, and knowledge extraction  
- **Control output granularity**: Specify the number of results and the amount of content per result  
- **Secure API access**: Protect your searches and data with API key authentication

In Sim, the Parallel AI integration empowers your agents to perform web searches and extract content programmatically. This enables powerful automation scenarios such as real-time research, competitive analysis, content monitoring, and knowledge base creation. By connecting Sim with Parallel AI, you unlock the ability for agents to gather, process, and utilize web data as part of your automated workflows.
