[Circleback](https://circleback.ai/) is an AI-powered platform that automates meeting notes, action items, transcripts, and recordings for your team. When a meeting is completed, Circleback processes the conversation and provides detailed notes and action items, along with a transcript and a recording (when available). This helps teams efficiently capture insights, distribute action items, and ensure nothing is missed—all seamlessly integrated into your workflows.

With the Sim Circleback integration, you can:

- **Receive detailed meeting notes and action items**: Automatically collect well-formatted meeting summaries and track actionable tasks discussed during your calls.
- **Access complete meeting recordings and transcripts**: Get the full conversation and the associated recording, making it easy to review key moments or share with colleagues.
- **Capture attendee information and meeting context**: Attendee lists, meeting metadata, and tags help keep your data organized and actionable.
- **Deliver insights directly into your workflows**: Trigger automations or send Circleback data to other systems the moment a meeting is done, using Sim’s powerful webhook triggers.

**How it works in Sim:**  
Circleback uses webhook triggers: whenever a meeting is processed, data is pushed automatically to your agent or automation. You can build further automations based on:

- Meeting completed (all processed data available)
- New notes (notes ready even before full meeting is processed)
- Raw webhook integration for advanced use cases

**The following information is available in the Circleback meeting webhook payload:**
