The IMAP Email trigger allows your Sim workflows to start automatically whenever a new email is received in any mailbox that supports the IMAP protocol. This works with Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo, and most other email providers.

With the IMAP trigger, you can:

- **Automate email processing**: Start workflows in real time when new messages arrive in your inbox.
- **Filter by sender, subject, or folder**: Configure your trigger to react only to emails that match certain conditions.
- **Extract and process attachments**: Automatically download and use file attachments in your automated flows.
- **Parse and use email content**: Access the subject, sender, recipients, full body, and other metadata in downstream workflow steps.
- **Integrate with any email provider**: Works with any service that provides standard IMAP access, without vendor lock-in.
- **Trigger on unread, flagged, or custom criteria**: Set up advanced filters for the kinds of emails that start your workflows.

With Sim, the IMAP integration gives you the power to turn email into an actionable source of automation. Respond to customer inquiries, process notifications, kick off data pipelines, and more—directly from your email inbox, with no manual intervention.
