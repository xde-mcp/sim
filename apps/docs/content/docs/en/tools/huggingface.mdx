## Tools

### `huggingface_chat`

Generate completions using Hugging Face Inference API

#### Input

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
| --------- | ---- | -------- | ----------- |
| `systemPrompt` | string | No | System prompt to guide the model behavior |
| `content` | string | Yes | The user message content to send to the model |
| `provider` | string | Yes | The provider to use for the API request \(e.g., novita, cerebras, etc.\) |
