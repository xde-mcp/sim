Credentials provide a secure way to manage API keys, tokens, and third-party service connections across your workflows. Instead of hardcoding sensitive values into your workflow, you store them as credentials and reference them at runtime.

Sim supports two categories of credentials: **secrets** for static values like API keys, and **OAuth accounts** for authenticated service connections like Google or Slack.

## Getting Started

To manage credentials, open your workspace **Settings** and navigate to the **Secrets** tab.

From here you can search, create, and delete both secrets and OAuth connections.

## Secrets

Secrets are key-value pairs that store sensitive data like API keys, tokens, and passwords. Each secret has a **key** (used to reference it in workflows) and a **value** (the actual secret).

### Creating a Secret

/>

<Steps>
  <Step>
    Click **+ Add** and select **Secret** as the type
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Enter a **Key** name (letters, numbers, and underscores only, e.g. `OPENAI_API_KEY`)
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Enter the **Value**
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Optionally add a **Description** to help your team understand what the secret is for
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Choose the **Scope** — Workspace or Personal
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Click **Create**
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Using Secrets in Workflows

To reference a secret in any input field, type `{{` to open the dropdown. It will show your available secrets grouped by scope.

<Image

  alt="Typing {{ in a code block opens a dropdown showing available workspace secrets"

/>

Select the secret you want to use. The reference will appear highlighted in blue, indicating it will be resolved at runtime.

  src="/static/credentials/secret-resolved.png"
  alt="A resolved secret reference shown in blue text as {{OPENAI_API_KEY}}"
  width={400}
  height={200}
/>

<Callout type="warn">
Secret values are never exposed in the workflow editor or logs. They are only resolved during execution.
</Callout>

### Bulk Import

You can import multiple secrets at once by pasting `.env`-style content:

1. Click **+ Add**, then switch to **Bulk** mode
2. Paste your environment variables in `KEY=VALUE` format
3. Choose the scope for all imported secrets
4. Click **Create**

The parser supports standard `KEY=VALUE` pairs, quoted values, comments (`#`), and blank lines.

## OAuth Accounts

OAuth accounts are authenticated connections to third-party services like Google, Slack, GitHub, and more. Sim handles the OAuth flow, token storage, and automatic refresh.

You can connect **multiple accounts per provider** — for example, two separate Gmail accounts for different workflows.

### Connecting an OAuth Account

<Image

  alt="Create Secret dialog with OAuth Account type selected, showing display name and provider dropdown"
  width={500}
  height={400}
/>

<Steps>
  <Step>
    Click **+ Add** and select **OAuth Account** as the type
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Enter a **Display name** to identify this connection (e.g. "Work Gmail" or "Marketing Slack")
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Optionally add a **Description**
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Select the **Account** provider from the dropdown
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Click **Connect** and complete the authorization flow
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Using OAuth Accounts in Workflows

Blocks that require authentication (e.g. Gmail, Slack, Google Sheets) display a credential selector dropdown. Select the OAuth account you want the block to use.

<Image
  src="/static/credentials/oauth-selector.png"
  alt="Gmail block showing the account selector dropdown with a connected account and option to connect another"
  width={500}
  height={350}
/>

You can also connect additional accounts directly from the block by selecting **Connect another account** at the bottom of the dropdown.

<Callout type="info">
If a block requires an OAuth connection and none is selected, the workflow will fail at that step.
</Callout>

## Workspace vs. Personal

Credentials can be scoped to your **workspace** (shared with your team) or kept **personal** (private to you).

| | Workspace | Personal |
|---|---|---|
| **Visibility** | All workspace members | Only you |
| **Use in workflows** | Any member can use | Only you can use |
| **Best for** | Production workflows, shared services | Testing, personal API keys |
| **Who can edit** | Workspace admins | Only you |
| **Auto-shared** | Yes — all members get access on creation | No — only you have access |

<Callout type="info">
When a workspace and personal secret share the same key name, the **workspace secret takes precedence**.
</Callout>

### Resolution Order

When a workflow runs, Sim resolves secrets in this order:

1. **Workspace secrets** are checked first
2. **Personal secrets** are used as a fallback — from the user who triggered the run (manual) or the workflow owner (automated runs via API, webhook, or schedule)

## Access Control

Each credential has role-based access control:

- **Admin** — can view, edit, delete, and manage who has access
- **Member** — can use the credential in workflows (read-only)

When you create a workspace secret, all current workspace members are automatically granted access. Personal secrets are only accessible to you by default.

### Sharing a Credential

To share a credential with specific team members:

1. Click **Details** on the credential
2. Invite members by email
3. Assign them an **Admin** or **Member** role

## Best Practices

- **Use workspace credentials for production** so workflows work regardless of who triggers them
- **Use personal credentials for development** to keep your test keys separate
- **Name keys descriptively** — `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` over `KEY1`
- **Connect multiple OAuth accounts** when you need different permissions or identities per workflow
- **Never hardcode secrets** in workflow input fields — always use `{{KEY}}` references
