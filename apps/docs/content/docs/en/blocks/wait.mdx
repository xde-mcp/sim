The Wait block pauses your workflow for a specified amount of time before continuing to the next block. Use it to add delays between actions, respect API rate limits, or space out operations.

<div className="flex justify-center">

    alt="Wait Block"

</div>

## Configuration

### Wait Amount

Enter the duration to pause execution:
- **Input**: Positive number
- **Maximum**: 600 seconds (10 minutes) or 10 minutes

### Unit

Choose the time unit:
- **Seconds**: For short, precise delays
- **Minutes**: For longer pauses

<Callout type="info">
  Wait blocks can be cancelled by stopping the workflow. The maximum wait time is 10 minutes.
</Callout>

## Outputs

- **`<wait.waitDuration>`**: The wait duration in milliseconds
- **`<wait.status>`**: Status of the wait ('waiting', 'completed', or 'cancelled')

## Example Use Cases

**API Rate Limiting** - Stay within API rate limits between requests
```
API (Request 1) → Wait (2s) → API (Request 2)
```

**Timed Notifications** - Send follow-up messages after a delay
```
Function (Send Email) → Wait (5min) → Function (Follow-up)
```

**Processing Delays** - Wait for external system to complete processing
```
API (Trigger Job) → Wait (30s) → API (Check Status)
```

## Best Practices

- **Keep waits reasonable**: Use Wait for delays up to 10 minutes. For longer delays, consider scheduled workflows
- **Monitor execution time**: Remember that waits extend total workflow duration
