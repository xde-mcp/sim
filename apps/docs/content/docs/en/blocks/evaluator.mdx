The Evaluator block uses AI to score and assess content quality against custom metrics. Perfect for quality control, A/B testing, and ensuring AI outputs meet specific standards.

## Configuration Options

### Evaluation Metrics

Define custom metrics to evaluate content against. Each metric includes:

- **Name**: A short identifier for the metric
- **Description**: A detailed explanation of what the metric measures
- **Range**: The numeric range for scoring (e.g., 1-5, 0-10)

Example metrics:

```
Accuracy (1-5): How factually accurate is the content?
Clarity (1-5): How clear and understandable is the content?
Relevance (1-5): How relevant is the content to the original query?
```

### Content

The content to be evaluated. This can be:

- Directly provided in the block configuration
- Connected from another block's output (typically an Agent block)
- Dynamically generated during workflow execution

### Model Selection

Choose an AI model to perform the evaluation:

- **OpenAI**: GPT-4o, o1, o3, o4-mini, gpt-4.1
- **Anthropic**: Claude 3.7 Sonnet
- **Google**: Gemini 2.5 Pro, Gemini 2.0 Flash
- **Other Providers**: Groq, Cerebras, xAI, DeepSeek
- **Local Models**: Ollama-compatible models

Use models with strong reasoning capabilities like GPT-4o or Claude 3.7 Sonnet for best results.

### API Key

Your API key for the selected LLM provider. This is securely stored and used for authentication.

## Example Use Cases

**Content Quality Assessment** - Evaluate content before publication
```
Agent (Generate) → Evaluator (Score) → Condition (Check threshold) → Publish or Revise
```

**A/B Testing Content** - Compare multiple AI-generated responses
```
Parallel (Variations) → Evaluator (Score Each) → Function (Select Best) → Response
```

**Customer Support Quality Control** - Ensure responses meet quality standards
```
Agent (Support Response) → Evaluator (Score) → Function (Log) → Condition (Review if Low)
```

## Outputs

- **`<evaluator.content>`**: Summary of the evaluation with scores
- **`<evaluator.model>`**: Model used for evaluation
- **`<evaluator.tokens>`**: Token usage statistics
- **`<evaluator.cost>`**: Estimated evaluation cost

## Best Practices

- **Use specific metric descriptions**: Clearly define what each metric measures to get more accurate evaluations
- **Choose appropriate ranges**: Select scoring ranges that provide enough granularity without being overly complex
- **Connect with Agent blocks**: Use Evaluator blocks to assess Agent block outputs and create feedback loops
- **Use consistent metrics**: For comparative analysis, maintain consistent metrics across similar evaluations
- **Combine multiple metrics**: Use several metrics to get a comprehensive evaluation
