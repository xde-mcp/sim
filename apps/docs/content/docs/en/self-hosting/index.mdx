## Requirements

| Resource | Small | Standard | Production |
|----------|-------|----------|------------|
| CPU | 2 cores | 4 cores | 8+ cores |
| RAM | 12 GB | 16 GB | 32+ GB |
| Storage | 20 GB SSD | 50 GB SSD | 100+ GB SSD |
| Docker | 20.10+ | 20.10+ | Latest |

**Small**: Development, testing, single user (1-5 users)
**Standard**: Teams (5-50 users), moderate workloads
**Production**: Large teams (50+ users), high availability, heavy workflow execution

<Callout type="info">
Resource requirements are driven by workflow execution (isolated-vm sandboxing), file processing (in-memory document parsing), and vector operations (pgvector). Memory is typically the constraining factor rather than CPU. Production telemetry shows the main app uses 4-8 GB average with peaks up to 12 GB under heavy load.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/simstudioai/sim.git && cd sim
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```
