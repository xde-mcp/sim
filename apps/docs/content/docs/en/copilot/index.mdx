Copilot is your in-editor assistant that helps you build and edit workflows. It can:

- **Explain**: Answer questions about Sim and your current workflow
- **Guide**: Suggest edits and best practices
- **Build**: Add blocks, wire connections, and configure settings
- **Debug**: Analyze execution issues and optimize performance

  Copilot is a Sim-managed service. For self-hosted deployments:
  1. Go to [sim.ai](https://sim.ai) → Settings → Copilot and generate a Copilot API key
  2. Set `COPILOT_API_KEY` in your self-hosted environment
