## Why we’re excited

Today we’re announcing our $7M Series A led by Standard Capital with participation from Perplexity Fund, SV Angel, YCombinator, and notable angels like Paul Graham, Paul Bucheit, Ali Rowghani, Kaz Nejatian, and many more. 
This investment helps us double‑down on our mission: make it simple for teams to build, ship, and scale agentic workflows in production.

## How we got here

We started earlier this year in our apartment in San Francisco. 
The goal was to rebuild our entire previous company (if you can call it that) from scratch on a visual framework. 
We figured that if we could at least build an AI sales and marketing operation solely using building blocks on a canvas, then anyone could build anything. 
Soon after, we'd built the foundation of what would become Sim. 
We were hellbent on being Open Source from day one, and we're proud that we've stuck to that commitment. 

## Progress so far

In just a short few months, Sim has grown from 0->18k Github stars, 60,000+ developers on the platform, and 100+ companies ranging from startups to large enterprises using Sim in production. 
We've processed over 10M+ workflows and are growing rapidly. 
We've built a stellar team of engineers who are passionate about building the future of agentic workflows.

## Our vision

We believe the next wave of software is agentic. 
Teams will compose specialized agents that reason, retrieve, and act—safely and reliably—across their business. 
Our focus is to provide the infrastructure and UX that make this practical at scale: from prototyping to production, from single‑agent flows to complex multi‑agent systems. 

On one end of the spectrum, there are SDKs and frameworks that are complex and require a lot of code to build and manage, and on the other end of the spectrum, there are platforms that are easy to use but severely limit in what you can build. 
Sim offers a platform that is both easy to use and powerful enough to build complex agentic workflows.

If you strip away the applications, workflows are all that's left. They're the foundation of the software industry, and they're the foundation of the future powered by Sim.

## What’s next

We’ll invest in building the community around Sim, and we'll continue to be relentlessly focused on building the best platform for agentic workflows. 

## We’re hiring

If you’re excited about agentic systems and want to help define the future of this space, we’d love to talk. We’re hiring across engineering, engineering, and more engineering. Oh, and design. [Apply here](https://sim.ai/careers)
